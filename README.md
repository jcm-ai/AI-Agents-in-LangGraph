# AI Agents in LangGraph
Build agentic AI workflows using LangChain's LangGraph and Tavily's agentic search.

### Explore the Lesson Notebooks
The repository contains several lesson folders, each focusing on a different aspect of building AI agents using LangGraph:
1. **Lesson 1 - Simple ReAct Agent from Scratch**
    - **Objective:** Learn the basics of building a ReAct agent.
    - **Steps:** Open the notebook and execute cells step by step. Review how the agent is initialized and how decision-making is implemented.

2. **Lesson 2 - LangGraph Components**
    - **Objective:** Understand the core components of LangGraph.
    - **Steps:** Follow along with the provided examples to see how different LangGraph components interact. Experiment by tweaking parameters.

3. **Lesson 3 - Agentic Search**
    - **Objective:** Implement an agent that performs search tasks.
    - **Steps:** Run the notebook to see how the search functionality is integrated. Observe how the agent processes queries and returns results.

4. **Lesson 4 - Persistence and Streaming**
    - **Objective:** Learn how to handle data persistence and stream outputs.
    - **Steps:** Execute the cells to see persistence in action. Check how streaming data is handled and logged.

5. **Lesson 5 - Human in the Loop**
    - **Objective:** Integrate human interaction into the agent's workflow.
    - **Steps:** Follow the provided examples to learn how human interaction is integrated into the agent's behavior.

6. **Lesson 6 - Essay Writer**
    - **Objective:** Build an agent that generates essays.
    - **Steps:** Run the notebook to see how the agent generates essays based on user inputs. Observe how the agent's responses are logged and persisted.
